AZURE Networks 

VNET -> Vnet also called as Virtual Network, which is used used configuare the security, policies to the project.

Use case ex-
let's say we in org, can have different projects. which projects needs heavy security and another no need of that much security.
so creating VNET for project which makes entire project secure and not secure

ex- there is one acre land sorunded by compund wall can be called called as VNET of that land/ project

one subcription can have multiple VNETS with projects

VNET ---
VNET can be consists of single/default/ multiple Subnets

Subnet is like, one VNET three Applications like Presention layer, Application layer and DATA layer.

from the outside using public IP address, users can not access Appliaction layer and DB layer so that case, we can three subnet for all three layers 

Presention Subnet used to deploy the -> Presention layer, which can be exposed to the public IP address

Appliaction Subnet used to deploy-> the apllication layer and can't be accessed from outside. only acceessed from presention layer [ this work can be done by using routeing table]


Subent has CIDR range of IPDAREESS -> 
IPV4 -> 65k Ipaddress 
ocatat format 
172.168.3.0/24  to 172.168.255.255/24 -> last bit if see 0 - 255 which 256 ipaddress can be provided 

Firewall -> is used proteced the complete VNET
firewall manger 
firewall subnet [ Ipaddress range can be configured ]

NSG -> network security group -> which attached to the subnet level or instance[one VM] 

ASG -> in one subnet ex - apllication subnet, there are 5 applications. so 2 can be exposed , and 3 sholud not exposed - using ASG three can be grouped as ASG and provide saparate seciry rules.

Bastion -> bastin is a azure service, used to conect the vm without public IPADDRESS [ using private address can be connected usin bastion service].

practiccal scenario -> devops engineers will configuare NSG + ASG both for the business logics and DB
